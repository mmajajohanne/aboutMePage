            The air, the conversations, the inner monologues, the sorrow. I remember once I
            discovered a used copy of Leaves of Grass. It was a Christmas gift exchanged by
            my parents. I flipped the pages, dog eared, warn, creased, yellowed by sun and
            time until I landed back at the start where I saw a note. A single annotation
            which my eyes glanced over and over following the trail of ink reading the
            words first to see what they said and then after to draw out the new and
            suddenly strange sense of time they evoked. I was inexplicably moved, not by
            love or realizing the note was written before I was born. No, it was a new
            feeling which now occurs anytime I am holding a book with someone else's handwriting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
            
            <p style='line-height:19.2pt'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.5pt;
            color:#675E3E;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>It is an awareness of a circuit being
            made by two people who often do not know each other. To hold the paper in your
            hand, warp the pages, read the same words in the same ink, but with different
            eyes. I feel the overlap of life in this immensely. And it is both that
            suddenly too much is existing simultaneously, two people connected at the hands
            and eyes. But also, that this is made real only on the fact that this exact
            copy of the book, even smaller, these&nbsp;</span><em><span lang=EN-US

            now in two places at once. Held in the eyes of the past holding the eyes of the
            present. To me, this is much the same as what I feel when I enter the month of
            August. This period transports me. I feel my multitudes collecting in my
            consciousness, settling somewhere I cannot see but understand to be my parent’s
            porch. Just after 4 o’clock their legs dangling off the edge, looking out at
            the lawn before its decay. If I close my <span class=GramE>eyes</span> it’s
            like being there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            color:#675E3E;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Why there? I have spent many waning
            summer afternoons in that exact position contemplating the time that has
            passed. August to me is ancient. The air, the conversations, the inner
            monologues, the sorrow. I recognize this month so easily, feel its arrival in
            trivial things. Finding that my mind naturally progresses to a kind of
            reworking that almost always happened in my adolescence and early twenties
            outside on those rough beams of wood marking the start of our house. Afternoons
            of profound understanding for the loss I was facing. The loss of my imagined
            selves. Taking inventory of what I’d hoped for in January to accept what has
            not quite come. The goals I made, the daydreams I thought were waiting here at
            the other half of the year.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            color:#675E3E;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The myriad of visions I had for my life
            were at varying levels of probability. I had hoped to have finished more
            chapters, to get a well-paying job, to pay my bills punctually, more money,
            more time, more readers, more visible attributes to building a life within my
            living day after day. Small and big things. Doable and sometimes impossible
            dreams that were nice to believe in because they were impossible. Yet none of
            those things arrived. In fact, nothing I had hoped for really did. Not for lack
            of trying, but still as a failure in a kind of way. Perhaps that is what loss really
            is. A failure to hold onto something, to keep it in your grasp even just your
            line of sight. I realized this in July. This feeling of failure frightened
            me.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            color:#675E3E;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>I can’t really explain it. Perhaps you
            understand the way this month arrives like water spilled on a tablecloth. How
            it spreads slowly, seeping into the space around it. Starting first at night
            with windy caresses, then afternoons with clouded coverage, until one morning
            you wake up and it is more than the start of a new month, it has gathered at
            your ankles. My consciousness began to excuse itself to my parent’s porch first
            as a guest and then as a resident. I needed to go there, I needed to remember
            my past failings <span class=GramE>in order to</span> articulate these ones. To
            minimize their impact and to accept them as they were, as August allows.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            it feels like showing up to a party that has already begun. There are past
            versions of me all around. A multitude of renditions. Women who remain
            imagined, women who arrived late, delayed, stuck in traffic having reworked
            their route here and arrived anyway. Women who had experienced August years ago
            who were me, who still are me. Each looking at themselves with distinct clarity
            and disappointment. We are all somehow thinking the same thing.&nbsp;</span><em><span

            color:#675E3E;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>August is not a solution, but a comfort.
            Often comfort is enough to find a solution anyway. To recalibrate the mind <span
            class=GramE>so as to</span> try for something even if you cannot achieve
            everything. I sit with the solitude of only being amongst yourselves and I
            listen to the sound of summer, which is fading quicker than I remember, and I
            look at what I wanted and where I am. There is a sudden jolt of remembering
            how. How to accept these versions of myself which will for now stay imaginary.
            But I realize here, each year, that I must work harder, move further and
            slower. The latter being the last thing to settle on me comfortably. There is a
            distinct self-awareness here, bravery, even civility which allows you to look
            directly into the heart of time to see where you have landed. Only in August do
            I have the mind to accept what I have not become. Everything here I have
            already felt before.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            without being afraid. It is no longer July. There is a community here. I have
            that same strange feeling for time. I am connected to the past by thoughts
            alone. These words are in two places at once. Nothing here is new. This is a
            good thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            I don’t see anyone looking. I could be alone in my room or on the subway
            platform in the early <span class=GramE>afternoon</span> but I feel someone
            around me. I close my eyes and revert to the porch, the invisible one that my
            conscious now lies in for 31 days. There is someone here, someone in the crowd
            of people who I had once been. One January she had dreamed and found in August
            failure. She is looking toward that dream. She is looking at me.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            destination. How strange.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            I could really step outside and be there, I’d be thinking about the end of
            summer. I’d be looking out at that <span class=GramE>lawn</span> and I’d watch
            some version of me. I don’t know how old she is, all I know is she has done
            what I had hoped for on late cold nights walking home. I’m sure she’ll tell me
            all about when she gets here. For now, time is moving slowly. Summer isn’t over
            yet. The traffic is still denser, the delays are still long. The end is coming
            but there’s a destination in there, a place to get to, and everyone must be
